Notes for Online IDE: https://Repl.it

To compile and run C++ code, perform following step.

1. Create .replit file (if not already exists)
2. Modify .replit file:
  a. language = "cpp"
  b. run = "g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName.out && ./fileName.out"
3. Modify the fileName as needed. Include the double quotes. 

Shortcut:
  If feeling lazy, just modify;;  run = "g++ fileName.cpp && ./a.out"
